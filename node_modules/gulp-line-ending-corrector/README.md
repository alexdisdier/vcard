# gulp-line-ending-corrector

Gulp Plugin for Line Ending Corrector (A utility that makes sure your files have consistent line endings) 

# about line-editing-corrector

It converts all those pesky `\r\n` (a.k.a `CRLF`) line endings in Microsoft Windows operating systems into the more commonly used and recognized `\n` (a.k.a `LF`). Though it lets you do the opposite as well ( converting `LF` to `CRLF` ). It supports `\r` (a.k.a `CR`) as well for the sake of completion.

You should definitely have this in your build process especially if someone in your team works from a non UNIX system.
